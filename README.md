Welcome to the docs-creation

To access the render documentation, just click on the url below:
<https://tomaspipes.github.io/docs-creation/>

All the documentation is written as markdown and converted to a static website
using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Jekyll is natively supported by GitHub
pages, when a new push with source changes are done, GitHub will build and
serve the website.

This page uses [just-the-docs](https://just-the-docs.com/) as a Jekyll
template. The theme is fetch from the public GitHub distribution during
the site build. Public dependencies are not best practice, but this was chosen
over the one natively supported by GitHub due to it's focus on documentation,
since the native ones usually have focus on blogs/releases.

just-the-docs templates are available under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit/)
